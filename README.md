## Dependency Management with Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Poetry simplifies the process of managing dependencies and packaging Python projects.

Once installed, you can easily manage dependencies by running `poetry add <dependency>` to add the new dependency and running `poetry install --no-root`, to install all the required packages listed in the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)
 file.


 ## Code Quality

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality and enforce coding standards:

- **[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)**: A code formatter that ensures consistent code style.
- **[pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/)**: A static code analysis tool to enforce coding standards and detect errors.
- **[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)**: A tool to sort and format imports automatically.
- **[mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)**: A static type checker to ensure type safety in Python code.

These tools are integrated with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), ensuring that they are automatically run before each commit to maintain code quality.

To manually run these tools, you can use the following commands:

`pre-commit run --all-files` or `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`
