## Dependency Management with Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Poetry simplifies the process of managing dependencies and packaging Python projects.

Once installed, you can easily manage dependencies by running `poetry add <dependency>` to add the new dependency and running `poetry install --no-root`, to install all the required packages listed in the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml)
 file.
