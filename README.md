## 📋 Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

## 📦 Dependency Management with Poetry

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Poetry simplifies the process of managing dependencies and packaging Python projects.

Once installed, you can easily manage dependencies by running `poetry add <dependency>` to add the new dependency and running `poetry install --no-root`, to install all the required packages listed in the [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) file.

## 🔧 Project Setup

Clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/renatoramossilva/ta-be-pn
cd ta-be-pn
```

There are three ways to set up the project:

  - Localhost
  - Docker container

### 🖥️ Running on the localhost

Initialize the application using `uvicorn` command:

```bash
> poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 🐳 Running on Docker container

Initialize the application using `docker` commands:

```bash
> docker build -t ta-be-pn-image -f docker/Dockerfile .
> docker run --rm -d -p 8000:8000 -p 5001:5001 ta-be-pn-image
```
- `--rm`: Automatically removes the container when it is stopped.
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- `-p 8000:8000`: This maps port 8000  (The FastAPI application runs on this port) inside the container to port 8000 on your local machine. You can access the app locally at http://localhost:8000.
- `-p 5001:5001`: This maps port 5001 inside the container to port 5001 on your local machine, which is used for test coverage reports. You can view the test coverage at http://localhost:5001.

### 🐙 Using Docker Compose

Initialize the application using `docker compose` command:

```bash
> docker compose up --build
```

Using the `docker-compose` option, a very simple user interface will be available to interact with the API. You can access it by navigating to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

To validate the endpoint, independently the way that the API was started, you can use the following `curl` command:

```bash
> curl -s 'GET' 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/coverage?address=42+rue+papernest+75011+Paris' | jq .
{
  "Orange": {
    "2G": true,
    "3G": true,
    "4G": false
  },
  "SFR": {
    "2G": true,
    "3G": false,
    "4G": false
  }
}
```

## 📜 API Documentation

You can find the API documentation at the following link: [API Documentation](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## 🧹 Code Quality

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality and enforce coding standards:

- **[black](https://black.readthedocs.io/)**: A code formatter that ensures consistent code style.
- **[pylint](https://pylint.pycqa.org/)**: A static code analysis tool to enforce coding standards and detect errors.
- **[isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/)**: A tool to sort and format imports automatically.
- **[mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)**: A static type checker to ensure type safety in Python code.

These tools are integrated with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), ensuring that they are automatically run before each commit to maintain code quality.

To manually run these tools, you can use the following commands:

`pre-commit run --all-files` or `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`

## 🧪 Unit tests

This project uses `pytest` for unit testing to ensure the functionality of key features like car bookings and availability checks.

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests locally:

`poetry run pytest`

### Testing Across Python Versions

To verify compatibility with different Python versions, the project is tested with Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. We use `tox` to automate testing across these Python versions.

`tox` or `poetry run tox`

## 📊 Tests Coverage

The coverage report provides a detailed analysis of the codebase, indicating which parts of the code are covered by tests and which are not. This helps in identifying untested areas and improving the overall test coverage. To generate the coverage report, run the following command:

You can access the test coverage report after setting up the project by navigating to [http://localhost:5001/](http://localhost:5001/). The coverage configuration is included in the Dockerfile, and the report is served on port 5001.

## 🚀 Continuous Integration

Whenever a pull request is opened, the GitHub Actions workflow will trigger and perform the following checks:

- Code Formatting: Run `black` and `isort` to format the code.
- Static Analysis: Execute `pylint` and `mypy` to ensure code quality.
- Unit Testing: Run `pytest` to execute the unit tests and check for coverage. (specifically 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12)

This setup ensures that only code that passes all checks is merged into the master branch, maintaining a high standard of code quality throughout the development process.
